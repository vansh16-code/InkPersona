InkPersona
InkPersona is a Django-based web application designed to help writers overcome writer's block by simulating interviews with fictional characters. It allows users to interact with their characters, ask them questions, and receive insightful responses that are contextually grounded in the characters' personalities, backstories, and fears. This tool is particularly useful for writers who need inspiration or direction for their stories.

Features
Character Interview Mode: Writers can create characters and simulate an interview with them, asking questions related to their story or personality.

Customizable Character Profiles: Each character can have a unique set of traits, backstory, fears, dreams, and secrets.

AI-Generated Responses: Using the Hugging Face Transformers library, responses from characters are generated based on their defined traits, providing realistic and creative dialogues.

Bootstrap UI: The frontend is built using Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.

Technologies Used
Django: The backend is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Hugging Face Transformers: Used for generating text responses using pre-trained language models (like GPT-2 or other models).

Bootstrap: Frontend styling is done using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive UI.

SQLite: Default database for storing character profiles, user-generated questions, and responses.
